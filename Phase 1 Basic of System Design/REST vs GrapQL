REST (Representational State Transfer)
--------------------------------------

-> REST is an architectural style for designing APIs. It uses HTTP methods to perform CRUD operations on resources (data entities).

-------------
Key Features:
-------------

Uses standard HTTP methods:

GET → Read

POST → Create

PUT/PATCH → Update

DELETE → Delete

Each resource has a unique URL (endpoint)

Data format usually JSON, sometimes XML

Stateless: Each request contains all necessary info

-------------
Pros of REST:
-------------

Simple and widely used

Cacheable

Works well with HTTP and standard web tools

-------------
Cons of REST:
-------------

Over-fetching: Get more data than needed

Under-fetching: Need multiple requests to get related data

Versioning needed when API changes

-------
GraphQL
-------

GraphQL is a query language for APIs (developed by Facebook). Instead of multiple endpoints, there is a single endpoint where clients can request exactly the data they need.

-------------
Key Features:
-------------

Single endpoint: /graphql

Clients define what fields they want

Returns exactly what is requested (no over-fetching)

Supports queries (read) and mutations (write)

Strongly typed schema


---------------------------------
Example (for a social media app):
---------------------------------

query {
  post(id: 123) {
    title
    author {
      name
      email
    }
  }
}

Response

{
  "data": {
    "post": {
      "title": "Hello",
      "author": {
        "name": "John",
        "email": "john@example.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
Pros of GraphQL:

Fetch exactly what you need → less bandwidth

Single endpoint → simpler for clients

Schema allows type checking

Easier to evolve APIs without versioning

Cons of GraphQL:

More complex to implement

Caching is harder compared to REST

Requires learning new query language

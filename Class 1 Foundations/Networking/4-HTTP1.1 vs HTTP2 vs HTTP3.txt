=============
What is HTTP?
=============

*) HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the communication protocol used between client (browser/app) and server.

========
HTTP/1.1
========

*) What it is
*) Released in 1997
*) Text-based protocol
*) Works on request → response model

============
How it works
============

1) Client sends a request to the server  
2) Server processes the request  
3) Server sends a complete response and the connection is closed (or reused)

*) One request is processed at a time per connection  
*) Browser opens multiple TCP connections to fetch multiple resources

============
Limitations
============

*) Head-of-line blocking  
*) High latency  
*) Repeated headers in every request  
*) Inefficient for modern web apps

========
HTTP/2
========

*) What it is
*) Released in 2015
*) Binary-based protocol
*) Designed to fix HTTP/1.1 performance issues
*) Used by gRPC and modern web applications

============
How it works
============

1) Client and server establish a single TCP connection  
2) Multiple requests and responses are sent in parallel (multiplexing)  
3) Data is split into binary frames and reassembled on the other side  

*) Single persistent connection  
*) No head-of-line blocking at application level  
*) Header compression (HPACK)

============
Advantages
============

*) Much lower latency  
*) Better performance  
*) Efficient network usage  
*) Supports server push  

============
Limitations
============

*) Still affected by TCP-level head-of-line blocking  
*) More complex than HTTP/1.1  

========
HTTP/3
========

*) What it is
*) Released in 2020
*) Based on QUIC protocol (runs over UDP)
*) Designed to replace HTTP/2
*) Used by Google, Cloudflare, YouTube

============
How it works
============

1) Client connects using QUIC over UDP  
2) Multiple independent streams are created  
3) Packet loss affects only one stream, not others  

*) No TCP handshake  
*) Built-in TLS 1.3  
*) Faster connection setup  

============
Advantages
============

*) No head-of-line blocking  
*) Very low latency  
*) Better performance on mobile networks  
*) Faster reconnection  

============
Limitations
============

*) Newer protocol (not everywhere)  
*) Harder to debug  
*) Requires modern infrastructure

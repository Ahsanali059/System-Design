==================================
WebSockets & Real-Time Communication
==================================

Types / Techniques:
*) WebSockets
*) Long Polling
*) Server-Sent Events (SSE)
*) gRPC Streaming

================
WebSockets
================

*) Full-duplex communication (both sides send anytime)
*) Persistent connection between client and server
*) Uses a single TCP connection

How it works:
1) Client sends HTTP request with Upgrade: websocket
2) Server accepts and upgrades protocol
3) Connection stays open for real-time data exchange

Use when:
*) Chat applications
*) Live notifications
*) Online gaming
*) Real-time dashboards

Limitations:
*) Connection management is complex
*) Stateful by nature

================
Long Polling
================

*) Client sends request and waits
*) Server holds request until data is available
*) Response is sent, then client re-requests

Use when:
*) WebSockets not available
*) Low-frequency updates

Limitations:
*) High latency
*) Wastes resources

========================
Server-Sent Events (SSE)
========================

*) One-way communication (server ? client)
*) Built on HTTP
*) Client keeps connection open

Use when:
*) Live feeds
*) Stock prices
*) Notifications (read-only)

Limitations:
*) Client cannot send data back
*) Limited browser support compared to REST

====================
gRPC Streaming
====================

*) Streaming over HTTP/2
*) Supports client, server, and bi-directional streaming
*) Binary data using Protobuf

Use when:
*) Microservices communication
*) High performance internal systems

Limitations:
*) Not browser friendly
*) Needs gRPC-Web for frontend

========================
Interview One-Liners
========================

*) WebSockets ? real-time, bi-directional communication
*) SSE ? one-way server updates
*) Long polling ? REST workaround
*) gRPC streaming ? backend-to-backend streaming

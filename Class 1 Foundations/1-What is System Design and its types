What is System Design ?
=======================

System Design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It’s about how the system works rather than what the system does.

Focus: Structure and behavior of the system.

Goal: Build scalable, maintainable, and efficient systems.

High-Level Design (HLD)

Low-Level Design (LLD)

-----------------------
HLD (High-Level Design)
-----------------------

High-Level Design describes the system architecture and overall structure without going into implementation details. It’s like a “macro” view.

Key Points:

Shows system components and their interactions.

Focuses on what modules exist and how they communicate.

Used to communicate with stakeholders and project managers.

Often includes diagrams like:

  Block diagrams
  
  Component diagrams
  
  Data flow diagrams

-------------------------------------------
HLD Example (for a web app like Instagram):
-------------------------------------------

Modules:

User Service

Post Service

Feed Service

Notification Service

External systems:

Database (MySQL, Redis)

CDN for images/videos

Architecture pattern: Microservices

Communication: REST APIs / gRPC

HLD Focus:

Components

Architecture (Monolithic / Microservices / Client-Server)

Data flow between modules

Technology stack (optional)
------------------------
LLD (Low-Level Design)
------------------------
Low-Level Design goes inside the modules. It shows how each module works internally with complete detail.

Key Points:

Focus on classes, methods, data structures, algorithms, interfaces.

Shows interaction between classes and methods.

Can include:

Class diagrams

Sequence diagrams

Database schema

API specifications

LLD Example (for Post Service in Instagram):

Classes:

PostController → handles HTTP requests

PostService → business logic

PostRepository → database interactions

Methods:

createPost(userId, content)

getFeed(userId)

Database tables:

posts(id, user_id, content, timestamp)

Interactions:

PostController calls PostService, which calls PostRepository
